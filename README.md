# flutterflies_learning README

## Getting Started
To get started, please follow the following commands:

1. git pull the project and actually start it
Make sure to setup and install the project. Instructions to do so are here: 
https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install

2. For an editor, I really like to use Android Studio with the Flutter Plugins installed. Please refer below:
- [For Android Studio](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/editor?tab=androidstudio)
- [For Visual Studio Code](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/editor?tab=vscode)

3. This will help you to get the application started and running. Once you are done, let's try
and run the project and deploy it to a test emulator device. Follow the instructions below:
- [For android studio](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/test-drive?tab=androidstudio)
- [For Visual Studio Code](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/test-drive?tab=vscode)

4. Once you deployed the application, you are ready to get started. For Lesson 1, [we will
be trying to build the first 2 screens of the design attached in this Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/B7teCnqt3GHEqau2v4wM3Q/Taskly-Sample-Note-Flutter-Learning-Project).
